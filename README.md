### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer at Noteless with a strong interest in AI 🦾

- 🎓 I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from NTNU, with specialization in AI.
- ♟ I've been working on my chess bot, which you can challenge on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/AnmolS99)!
- ✍️ I sometimes write technical posts on my [blog](https://anmols.bearblog.dev/). My latest post explains [multithreading and multiprocessing in Python](https://anmols.bearblog.dev/understanding-multithreading-and-multiprocessing-in-python/).
