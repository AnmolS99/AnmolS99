# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Guide

## Repository Overview

This is a **GitHub Profile README Repository** (`AnmolS99/AnmolS99`) where README.md automatically displays on https://github.com/AnmolS99.

**Owner:** Anmol Singh (Anmol_singh@live.no)
**Type:** Static profile documentation
**Structure:** Only README.md is tracked (no dependencies, build tools, or CI/CD)

```
/home/user/AnmolS99/
├── README.md    # Profile content
└── CLAUDE.md    # This file
```

## Key Guidelines

### Content Focus
- Current role at Noteless, AI interests, education (Master's CS/AI from NTNU)
- Projects (chess bot on Lichess), blog posts, technical achievements
- Professional but approachable tone
- Minimal emoji usage, validate all links

### What to Avoid
- Don't invent information - only use verified facts
- Don't add build tools, dependencies, or new files unless requested
- Don't over-engineer - this is intentionally simple
- Keep it scannable and concise

## Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Always read README.md first** to understand current structure
2. **Make targeted edits** - preserve existing tone and formatting
3. **Use GitHub-flavored Markdown** - validate links and syntax
4. **Follow commit pattern:** "Update README.md" (simple, like all 11 commits in history)

### Git Operations

```bash
# Feature branches must start with claude/
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README.md"
git push -u origin claude/branch-name
```

**Important:** Use `git push -u origin <branch-name>` for feature branches starting with `claude/`

## Common Tasks

**Add blog post:** Read current format → Edit blog section → Maintain pattern → Commit "Update README.md with latest blog post"

**Update role:** Read current → Edit company/position → Preserve emoji → Commit "Update README.md with new position"

**Add project:** Read format → Add bullet point → Include name/description/link → Commit appropriately
